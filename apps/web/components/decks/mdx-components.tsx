/**
 * The closed vocabulary injected into every slide. A slide cannot `import`, so
 * this map is the whole surface area available to deck authors — which is what
 * keeps the chrome unbreakable and stops one slide from pulling in a library.
 *
 * Adding a component here is a deliberate widening of the system; prefer
 * composing what already exists.
 *
 * It is built per deck rather than exported as a constant because one entry —
 * `SponsorTier`, which writes "6 disponibles" or "6 open" — needs to know the
 * deck's language. The map is the injection point the system already has, so
 * the language rides in through it rather than through a context a Server
 * Component cannot read.
