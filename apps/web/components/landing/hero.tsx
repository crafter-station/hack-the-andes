 * The drawn hero.

 * lockup centred beneath it, and the liquid gathered along the line where the
 * two meet. Nothing to explore and nowhere to fly — the camera is parked, and
 * the one thing the hero asks for is a sideways drag, which turns the range on
 * the spot.

       * section in it makes the whole document taller mid-scroll, and
       * everything below moves down with it — which from inside the page reads
       * as the content jumping backwards while you scroll forwards. Caught in a
       * 60fps recording: the jump lands on the exact frame Chrome's bar
       * collapses.
       *
       * `svh` is the small viewport — the height with the chrome shown — and it
       * does not change when the chrome goes. The cost is that once the bar
       * hides, the section is a bar's height short of the screen; that is the
       * trade this unit exists to make.
