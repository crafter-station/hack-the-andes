/**
 * The card's faces, as the texture the glTF model expects.
 *
 * `card.glb` maps its two faces onto one atlas: the front samples the left
 * half, the back samples the right. Handing it a single portrait image is
 * what makes a custom card bleed across both sides or arrive cropped — the
 * same problem react-bits PR #977 exists to solve. So this draws both halves
 * into one image, each half at the card's own aspect.
 *
 * Rendered with satori, the same compositor the share image uses, so the two
 * pictures of a credential cannot drift apart in type or palette.
 *
 * A module rather than a route because two routes need it: the public
 * badge, which finds someone by their GitHub handle, and the participant's
 * own page, which knows them from their session. Duplicating five hundred
 * lines of layout is how two cards for one event start to differ.
