/**
 * The accepted participant behind a session.
 *
 * The credential is for people who were accepted. Its defaults come from
 * their application, while its public name, one-liner, link and confirmed
 * picture may be changed later through the independent badge profile.
 *
 * There is no lookup by GitHub handle any more, and its absence is the
 * design rather than an omission. A public route keyed on a handle could
 * only reach someone through the optional, free-text link on their form,
 * so it missed every participant who left it blank and let anyone
 * enumerate the ones who did not. The session has neither problem.
 *
 * Two rules out of `CONTEXT.md` bind every query here:
 *
 * - an *active* application is one being drafted, awaiting a decision, or
 *   accepted, and a participant may have only one at a time. Rejected and
 *   withdrawn applications are history. A credential must never be built
 *   from history — someone rejected this year would otherwise keep a
 *   badge from a form they filled in once;
 * - an acceptance badge may begin with the picture reviewers already saw;
 *   after attendance confirmation, the confirmed profile picture replaces
 *   that default.
 *
 * `pictureUrl` and `githubUrl` still arrive here as separate fields. The
 * former is the picture currently selected by the badge profile; the latter
 * is an alternative the participant may choose during confirmation.
