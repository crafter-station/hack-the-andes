/**
 * The participant's portrait, screened into dots.
 *
 * Replaces a call to an image model that redrew the photograph as pixel
 * art. The credential they open carries a halftone, so pixel art in the
 * image they save is the same person in two visual languages at one
 * event — and a deterministic screen cannot time out, cost anything per
 * participant, or return a face that is not theirs.
 *
 * It keeps its own task rather than folding into the composition step so
 * the retry boundary, the queue and the stored intermediate stay where
 * they were. The columns still say `pixelArt`: renaming them is a
 * Drizzle migration that asks interactively whether it is a rename or a
 * drop, and answering that wrong loses data.
